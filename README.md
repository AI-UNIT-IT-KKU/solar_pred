##  Overview

This project presents a **machine learningâ€“based solar power forecasting system** trained on real solar panel sensor data collected over a full year with minute-level resolution.  
The system predicts **active power output (W)** based on irradiance, temperature, and environmental features.  
Two models were developed and compared:
- **XGBoost Predictive Model (1-minue aggregation)**

The **15-minute LightGBM** model achieved higher accuracy and better short-term forecasting stability.

---

##  Objectives
- Predict **real-time solar power output** with high accuracy.  
- Handle **seasonal and non-linear variations** in irradiance and temperature.  
- Deploy a **Flask web app** for real-time prediction and visualization.  
- Compare forecasting intervals (hourly vs. 15-min).  
- Provide clear visual analysis and system explainability.

##  Flask Web Deployment

A **Flask-based interactive web app** allows users to:
- Input real solar data manually or use automatic time detection.
- Generate instant predictions from the trained model.
- Automatically reset the page after refresh for a clean interface.
