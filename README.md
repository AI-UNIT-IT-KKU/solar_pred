##  Overview

This project presents a **machine learningâ€“based solar power prediction system** trained on real solar panel sensor data collected over a full year with minute-level resolution.  
The system predicts **active power output (W)** based on irradiance, temperature, and environmental features.  
- **XGBoost Predictive Model (1-minue aggregation)**

The **1-minute XGBoost** model achieved higher accuracy and better short-term forecasting stability.

---

##  Objectives
- Predict **real-time solar power output** with high accuracy.  
- Handle non-linear variations** in irradiance and temperature.  
- Deploy a **FastAPI web app** for real-time prediction and visualization.  
- Provide clear visual analysis and system explainability.

##  Flask Web Deployment

A **FastAPI-based** application (decoupled frontend/backend) allows users to:
- Input the 6 required operational features (like ISC, GEFF, and temperatures).
- Generate instant predictions by sending data to a JSON API endpoint (/api/predict).
- Receive predictions without a page reload, ensuring a clean interface on every refresh.
